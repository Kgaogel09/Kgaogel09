# Aweh, I'm Thorn 😉

Frontend Developer with 5+ years of experience building fast, reliable, and user-focused interfaces. I work mostly with React, Next.js, Angular, and TypeScript, and I enjoy turning complex UI ideas into clean, scalable products.

I’m big on performance, design systems, and writing code that's easy to maintain.
In a nutshell, I bring digital experiences to life, focusing on clean code and pixel-perfect execution.
